[Buy me a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=9YVMYEDHHWT5J&no_recurring=1&item_name=Buy+me+a+coffee%21&currency_code=USD)

Have only tested this code with a Niimbot D11

Should be able to open this right in android studio and build a working sample app. 

Code based of python implementation found here: https://github.com/kjy00302/niimprint
